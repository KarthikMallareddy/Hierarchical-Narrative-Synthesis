Title: The Future of Hierarchical Narrative Synthesis

Hierarchical Narrative Synthesis (HNS) represents a paradigm shift in how we process information. Instead of flat summaries, HNS structures data into layers of abstraction.

At the lowest level, we have raw data—heterogeneous and noisy.
At the middle layer, we have representation learning, where autoencoders compress this data into latent concepts.
At the highest level, generative AI synthesizes these concepts into coherent narratives.

This approach is particularly useful for complex reporting where "what happened" is less important than "why it matters" and "how it connects to the bigger picture."
